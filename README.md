# Predicting-strokes-using-Machine-Learning
Used Machine Learning to predict the occurrence of a stroke based on some parameters, such as: gender, age, previous diseases, or smoking.
Python was used as programming language along with the following libraries and frameworks: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Tensorow and Keras.
This work was carried out by utilising Random Forest, Linear Regression based algorithms and Artificial Neural Networks, which outperformed the other algorithms.
